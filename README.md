<h2>JavaScript Calculator</h2>
<p>Taken inspirations from CodePen Web Dev Trick and GitHub romeojeremiah, I have created a calculator of my own, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its ability is still limited, and can only calculate simple equations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and remainder. There will also be cases in which the code will not work.</p>
<h2>Quick thoughts</h2>
<p>Pretty happy that I have done something useful, although it took me quite a while to figure it out.</p>
